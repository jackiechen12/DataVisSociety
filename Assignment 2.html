<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"><b>Has the quantity of flipped residence sales increased in Boston? </b>This study from AttomData (https://www.attomdata.com/news/market-trends/flipping/attom-year-end-2022-u-s-home-flipping-report/) indicates that nationally, flipping homes is growing in practice; I am curious to know if this is the case in Boston. </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"><b>Has house flipping increased the price of homes in Boston?</b> The mentioned aforementioned study from AttomData says that the returns from flipping homes has decreased and I am curious to see if this is the case for Boston. </span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"><b>Has there been an increased in housing flipping in low-income communities?</b> This study from Homes For Profits (https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report) argues that investor activity tend to occur in regions with low housing prices, which tend to be where BIPOC populations live. Is this also the case in Boston?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Discoveries &amp; Insights</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">In this exploratory analysis, we will work with the "Residential sales data in the City of Boston, 2000-2022." I am specifially interested in learning how flipping homes have impacted the affordability of single family homes. We start our exploratory analysis by looking at various univariate data plots to understand and assess the data quality and distribution.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<img src="Screenshot 2024-02-18 at 3.29.47 PM" alt="Italian Trulli">
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This chart shows the distribution of the price of residential properties sold in the City of Boston. From this chart, it appears that the plot skews right, meaning that there are some expensive, but lower volume sales. Additionally, there are multiple sales at a price that seem too low for a house, such as $1. Looking into the data to understand these outliers, I noticed that the "usage" field contains properties that are not I would not conisder residential housing (e.g. hotel, gas station, parking garage), but the title of the dataset makes it seem like the entire dataset is residential housing sales.  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Because we want to see how investors flipping homes affects one's ability to buy a single family home, this chart was created, showing the distribution of the price of properties sold in Greater Boston filtered on usage to include single family homes. Specifically, only homes with usage value of "1-FAM RES" and "CONDOMONIUM" (note that this may not perfectly capture all single family homes and I would ideally discuss with the data owner to understand the best filters to use). This filter does not seem to only capture single family homes as some of these transactions seem to be for an entire condo complex, such as the 360M+ transaction. We would need to revisit how to better filter for single-family homes, but for now, I will continue with this filter, recognizing its limitations. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This chart is a map of the zip codes contained within the dataset. It appears that some zip codes do not appear in this dataset, meaning either there were no sales in these zip codes or that there is missing data. Comparing against a map of Boston (https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/ZipCodes_tcm3-47884.pdf), I noticed that Brookline is also included (zip 02445 02446) but it is not considered part of Boston. I see that the missing areas are zip codes 02203 (which is fine because the population is 0) and 02120 (which has a population of ~15,000); therefore, this dataset is likely missing some data, and it would be worth seeing if any data is missing for the other zip codes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This chart is a map of the zip codes contained within the dataset with color-coding indicating the counts of the occurrence of the zip code. This confirms my suspicion that the dataset is incomplete as there is seems to be a concentration of sales in the main business/commercial areas, and I expect more sales in the outskirts, residential areas. Additionally, there a four records with unrecognizable zip codes, which may be due to entry error. Knowing that the data is likely incomplete, I should remain skeptical in the rest of my exploratory analysis and recognize that this may not be a good dataset to understand if there is more homes being flipped in certain communities. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> This univariate graph looks at the spread of the dates of the sale of a property. The dates data appear to be complete, but it is worth drilling down to see if the data has any issues. I do note that the average number of sales per year has not changed, which is surprising because if supply stays the same and demand increases, we should expect the quantity sold to increase according to economics. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> I drilled down on the dates to display more granularity, so this graph shows the spread of dates grouped by quarter and year. For every year, except for 2020 when the pandemic occurred, sales tend to peak during Q2 and Q3, which follows general house market patterns (houses are mostly sold/bought during the spring and summer). No data abnormalities were observed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">To understand the historical patterns in flipped housing sales, the year-counts graph is split into flipped and non-flipped sales. It appears that sales of flipped housing started in 2010 but has not significantly grown in volume. I wonder what occurred in 2010 that started the house flipping market in Boston. I also question whether we are correctly categorizing flipped housing because from the metadata description, it seems that sales are considered flipped housing if the purchase and subsequent sale of the house occurred within 2 years, but flipping a house may take longer than 2 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Diving deeper into the flipped house sellers, we observe the flipped house sales split by Investor Type of the seller. Interestingly, most of the volume of home flipping appears to be done by Non-investors, but it is unclear to be what a non-investor may be. My guess is that a non-investor includes any individual not part of an LLC or business, but I would need to talk with someone familiar with real estate or the data to confirm. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Because the data seems to indicate that flipping homes started picking up around 2010 in Greater Boston, we can see how the market changed before and after 2010 to observe any correlation. Here we see the trendline of the average prices of houses sold by year. The trendline after 2010 is steeper compared to before 2010, which indicates that flipping homes may have contributed to rising cost of homes in Boston. I wonder what other factors may have contributed to the steeper rising prices post 2010.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">To understand how lucrative house flipping is, I plotted the price difference (between when the house was bought and sold by the selling party) by year after 2010 (when the house flipping market took off) of houses marked as flipped by the indicator field. I noticed some outliers (2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020 specifically). From this plot, it appears that it is not umcommon that flipping houses results in a financial loss, but overall, people tend to profit from it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This graph plots the average price difference by year after 2010 and filtered on houses that are labeled as flipped. House flipping does seem lucrative because the plot shows that flippers seem to typically earn around 200k to 400k on average per flipped home (not accounting for the cost of renovations, but this would be interesting to look into). But as noted before, the way flipped housing indicator is determined, the potential incompleteness of the data, and how the filters may not capture only single family homes makes me less confident about how much is earned from flipping a home. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Summary</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">My exploratory data analysis has left me with many questions that I would like to ask the manager of the datasource/dataset. First, I would like to know if the dataset is complete (contains all housing purchases in the Greater Boston area) as the volume of sales in certain areas less than what I expected and property sales in certain zip codes were not found. Second, I would ask whether this dataset contains non-residential properties as various non-residential categories were observed in the "usage" field, and I would ask for guidance on filtering this dataset. Third, I would like to understand the investor type and other fields that categorize the parties involved in the housing transaction to clarify (e.g. who is considered a non-investor party). For me, the most interesting finding was that house flipping seemed to have started after 2010; I am curious to learn what policies and economic incentives became present that encouraged house flipping in Boston. It would be interesting to see other datasets about housing and try to find any patterns and changes following 2010. Comparing pre- and post- 2010, housing prices grew faster after 2010, when house flipping gained traction in Boston, which could indicate that house flipping may have impacted housing prices. As noted, there are several concerns with the completeness of the data and how to filter it to capture single family residences. Using other datasets to supplement this dataset, we could explore more about who exactly are flipping homes in Boston, confirm how much they are upselling flipped homes, and see how this affects housing affordability, especially in historically marginalized communities. We could also expand beyond single family residences and explore how investors in the region have affected the rent for residents of Boston.
